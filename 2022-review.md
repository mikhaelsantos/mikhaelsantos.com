# Reviewing 2022

As the year closes, it's a time for reflection and celebration of all we've achieved. And our team has undoubtedly had a successful year, with some notable efforts that we're proud to see running relative to DevOps and CloudOps.

One of the year's highlights was the active growth of our developer community on Slack, with a 33% increase in posts and members and a 57% increase in users actively viewing the posts. This growth is a testament to the value that developers place on this community as a place to connect, share ideas, and collaborate.

Another significant achievement was the implementation of Cloud Syncs, a systematic monthly discussion of operational and development topics with all domains in the Sanoma Media Finland. These discussions have covered a wide range of topics, from cost-saving efforts to hands-on work, and have helped to bring everyone together to tackle challenges and find solutions.

We've also implemented a process called Cloud Improvement Proposals (CIPS) to review and finalize decisions on policies to be implemented across the company. This process has proven to be a valuable tool for ensuring that all voices are heard, and decisions are made transparently and fairly.

In addition to these efforts, we've also started the Dev Council, a forum for open discussion and interaction among developers. The Dev Council has begun discussing a unified SMF Tech Radar and common Sanoma Media Finland Developer Guidelines, which will be vital in driving innovation and collaboration within the company.

All of these achievements and more have been made possible thanks to the hard work and dedication of our team and the active participation of developers in these initiatives. We're excited to see what the next year holds, and we're confident that we will continue to make great things happen with everyone's commitment.
