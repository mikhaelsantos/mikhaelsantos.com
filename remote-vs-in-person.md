Scrolling through Hacker News, I start seeing these oversimplified discussions of Remote Vs In-person work. It starts getting tiring because I hear people repeat the articles they read and have the same conversations repeatedly.

Let's start by acknowledging that in-person and remote work dynamics are different. Each has pros and cons, some of which strongly depends on the individual.

You can't have the best of both worlds. If you take two average companies similar in every way, but company A is fully remote, they will get things done but lack innovation. If company B is entirely in-person, then they will be more innovative and creative but will not be able to push out features as fast. The way to get the best of both worlds is a hybrid approach. 

The tough questions are:
* Do companies' current team structures support hybrid working? 
* What does a hybrid organization look like?

The current answer from Big Tech is structures stay the same, but mandatory days are added, hoping that those days are the 'innovation days' and remote days are execution days.

The path to better hybrid work is to create a clear separation between innovation and execution days. 
Remote and in-person have yet to solve the most significant problems: 
* poor planning
* unnecessary meetings and sync.
 
Until these challenges are solved, it makes little difference where we are working.
