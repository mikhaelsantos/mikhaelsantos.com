# Predictions for 2023

It is the last day of the year; I have reviewed the past year [here](2022-review.md), but now here come my 2023 predictions: 

**AI/ML:** AI/ML will get much attention, with businesses asking tech teams about what can be done and how much it costs. This will primarily be caused by ChatGPT and all the useful and useless use cases created.

**Tech Costs:** Operational and development costs are not a stranger to being in the cross-hair of cutting costs. However, given the geopolitical and economic situation, they will be back in the spotlight. Cloud costs and SASS costs will be challenged, and teams will be challenged to prove their usefulness. 

**Platform Engineering:** Platform engineering in the form of self-serving internal developer portals will get more traction partly because of the tech cost optimization and the tech / human resource landscape. Teams need to do more with less, and the multiplication factor of platform engineering is very tempting. 

**Low-Code/No-Code:** Driven by the innovations in ML/AI (examples Co-Pilot and ChatGPT), there will be a boost in this area, but the tech will not be used by people that don't know how to code; developers will use it to speed up their development. 

**Sustainability and GreenOps:** It has been discussed a lot, but with more legislation on the way and improved tooling, this topic will gain more traction in 2023. 

**Remote vs In-Person:** The Remote vs In-Person battle will continue, with most online articles and companies not getting the point that it doesn't matter whether remote vs in-person; what matters is the desired outcome. Read more about my view on this topic [here](remote-vs-in-person.md).

**As a summary statement**, I think, especially in Europe, companies will brace for tough economic times in 2023. While all these exciting predictions and tech might help prepare for 2023 troubles, I believe that the companies that will strive the best in 2023 will not need all this tech but will require substantial culture shifts internally to share, reuse and optimize across their silos and not only in the tech side.

Thank You for reading and Happy 2023!!
